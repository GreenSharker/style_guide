Development Goals as the Corporate Partner for the Responsible Business Forum on Sustainable Development 2018

    (SINGAPORE, Oct. 10, 2018 PRNewswire=연합뉴스) As a company whose purpose is to make the world healthier and happier, premier global nutrition company, Herbalife Nutrition, has been named a corporate partner for the Responsible Business Forum on Sustainable Development 2018 [http://www.responsiblebusiness.com/forum/responsible-business-forum-sustainable-development-2018/ ], affirming its support for the United Nation's Sustainable Development Goals (UNSDG) for the third year running.

    Organized by Global Initiatives and the United Nations Development Programme at Marina Bay Sands in Singapore from October 11 to 12, the Forum will feature Herbalife Nutrition's Head of Government Affairs, Tod Gimbel, in two panel discussions. In the first panel discussion on food and nutrition, Gimbel will be sharing about the company's contributions towards the UNSDGs via its network of Nutrition Clubs around the world. In the second panel discussion on the role of public-private partnerships, he will share about the partnerships that Herbalife Nutrition has forged, to help the health and nutrition industry move forward in achieving the UNSDGs.

    "Our unique business model, focusing on health-and-nutrition-centered grassroots engagement through our network of Nutrition Clubs, has enabled consumers in Asia Pacific and around the world to benefit from the power of positive nutrition, as well as nutrition education. This not only contributes to the UNSDG of Improving Global Health and Well-Being, it also provides work and opportunity to people from all over the world," said Stephen Conchie, Senior Vice President and Managing Director, Herbalife Nutrition Asia Pacific.

    With over 90,000 Nutrition Clubs in operation around the world, each locally-run Nutrition Club serves as a social enterprise, enabling easy access to health and nutrition products through the provision of individual serving portions at affordable prices to local consumers. Featuring a warm and friendly environment where members come together to share general health, wellness and nutrition information in a social atmosphere, Nutrition Club members are also trained to provide consumers with nutrition coaching to help them lead healthier and happier lives through a combination of positive nutrition and healthy active lifestyles.

    "As we gather speed to collectively tackle the key global health issues including rising obesity rates and rapidly aging populations, public-private partnerships will become increasingly important in the drive towards a healthier Asia Pacific region. On this note, Herbalife Nutrition is also partnering with health ministries and other stakeholders around the region to collectively boost public awareness of modern-day health issues, while instilling positive lifestyle habits to transform consumer lifestyles for the better," said Tod Gimbel, Vice President, Government Affairs, Herbalife Nutrition Asia Pacific.
